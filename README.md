COMP 3850 Bonus Assignment

- The file "crint.txt" provides a list of 7X4 matrices that trains the neural network. 

- These matrices represent a 6x4 'image' of what a number looks like followed by a four bit binary representation of the number shown.

- In order to add to the "knowledge" just add a 7x4 matrix to the list and increment the first integer of the file which is the number of matrices to learn in the file.

- The output of the network is also 4 digit binary number which is converted to decimal.

- The file "train_data.txt" is provided because it was trained already. If retraining is desired, one may do so from within the program.

- Training takes around 20-30 seconds.

- the 6x4 matrix may be input using 0's and 1' in the file "input.txt". Non-binary characters are ignored so the format does not matter once 24 0's or 1's are there, a result will be shown.
